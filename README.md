# Tiny_React
This repository documents the journey of learning React by building multiple small projects using React and Tailwind CSS. Each project focuses on strengthening core concepts like components, props, state management, and basic hooks, while also improving my UI skills with Tailwind. Instead of following only tutorials, I’m learning by building and experimenting, gradually increasing complexity as my understanding grows.

## BG_Changer
A simple React application that lets users change the background color of the screen using interactive buttons. The project is built to understand core React concepts like state management along with Tailwind CSS utility classes for layout, positioning, and hover effects.
